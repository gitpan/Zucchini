NAME
    Zucchini - turn templates into static websites

SYNOPSIS
      $ zucchini --create-config    # create a default config

      $ perldoc Zucchini::Config    # information for configuring Zucchini

      $ perldoc zucchini            # the worker script

DESCRIPTION
    You have a hosted website. It's static. Your website has the same
    headers, footers, menu, etc.

    Copying the same change from the header section in one file into the
    other fifty-eight files in your site is boring. It's also prone to
    error.

    Ideally the site would be written using some kind of templating system,
    so header files et al only needed to be updated once.

    This is where Zucchini comes in. Zucchini processes a directory of
    templates (written using Template::Toolkit markup) and outputs a static
    copy of each processed template.

    You now have the source for a staic website, waiting to be uploaded to
    your remote server - which, conveniently, Zucchini can do for you; using
    rsync or ftp.

    Zucchini is usually invoked through the "zucchini" script, which is
    installed as part of the package.

METHODS
  new
    Creates a new instance of the top-level Zucchini object:

      # create a new zucchini object
      $zucchini = Zucchini->new(
        \%cliopt
      );

  gogogo
    This function is called from the "zucchini" script and decides what
    actions to perform based on the command-line options passed to new()

      # work out what to do, and Just Do It
      $zucchini->gogogo;

  process_templates
    This function processes the template directories and outputs the static
    website source files.

      # generate the static site
      $zucchini->process_templates;

  ftp_sync
    This function transfers the static website source files to the remote
    server using an FTP solution.

      # transfer files to remote FTP site
      $zucchini->ftp_sync;

  remote_sync
    This function transfers the static website source files to the remote
    server using an rsync solution.

      # transfer files to remote server, using rsync
      $zucchini->remote_sync;
