# NAME

Zucchini - turn templates into static websites

# VERSION

version 0.0.18_02

# SYNOPSIS

    $ zucchini --create-config    # create a default config

    $ perldoc Zucchini::Config    # information for configuring Zucchini

    $ perldoc zucchini            # the worker script

# DESCRIPTION

You have a hosted website. It's static. Your website has the
same headers, footers, menu, etc.

Copying the same change from the header section in one file into
the other fifty-eight files in your site is boring.
It's also prone to error.

Ideally the site would be written using some kind of templating
system, so header files et al only needed to be updated once.

This is where Zucchini comes in. Zucchini processes a directory
of templates (written using [Template::Toolkit](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Template::Toolkit) markup) and outputs
a static copy of each processed template.

You now have the source for a staic website, waiting to be uploaded
to your remote server - which, conveniently, Zucchini can do for you;
using rsync or ftp.

Zucchini is usually invoked through the `zucchini` script, which is installed
as part of the package.

# METHODS

## new

Creates a new instance of the top-level Zucchini object:

    # create a new zucchini object
    $zucchini = Zucchini->new(
      \%cliopt
    );

## gogogo

This function is called from the `zucchini` script and decides what
actions to perform based on the command-line options passed to new()

    # work out what to do, and Just Do It
    $zucchini->gogogo;

## process_templates

This function processes the template directories and outputs the static
website source files.

    # generate the static site
    $zucchini->process_templates;

## ftp_sync

This function transfers the static website source files to the remote server
using an FTP solution.

    # transfer files to remote FTP site
    $zucchini->ftp_sync;

## remote_sync

using an rsync solution.

    # transfer files to remote server, using rsync
